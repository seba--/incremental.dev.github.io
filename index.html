<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The energy consumption of data centers and ICT devices grows at an alarming rate and will be responsible for up to 20% of the global energy consumption by 2030. To sustain the ongoing digital transformation, we must find ways to run software dramatically more efficiently. A promising direction is <em>incremental computing</em>. Incremental computations react to input changes rather than recomputing their result from scratch, which is known to deliver asymptotic speedups in theory and order-of-magnitude speedups in practice. 
</p><p>    
However, current approaches to incrementality have limited applicability: They either require expert knowledge, or only support specialized domains (e.g. database queries), or only yield modest speedups. The goal of this project is to develop a methodology for automatically incrementalizing computations and significantly improving their time and energy efficiency.
</p><p>
The AutoInc project achieves this ambitious goal by establishing a novel foundation for <em>incremental computing</em> in three complementary parts:
<ul>
<li>A library of incremental operators for atomic and other essential data types,</li>
<li>A low-level intermediate representation (IR) for describing compositional incremental computations,</li>
<li>An optimizing compiler that translates existing code to the low-level incremental IR.</li>
</ul>
